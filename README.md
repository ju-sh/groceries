# Groceries

 - A grocery list maker.
 - Create list of items for use while shopping for groceries.

#### How to use?

 - Check the items that you need included in the grocery list
 - Each checked item must have a quantity associated with it
 - Each item can have an optional comment associated with it
 - If you need an item that's not already present in the list, scroll to the end of the page and click on new item to add a new item
 - Once you have selected all items that you need in the list, click on the 'Generate list' button always visible on the top of the page
 - A dialog box with the list will pop up
 - Select and copy the text. And that's it!


I have tried this only on Firefox, but should work fine on all modern browsers.
